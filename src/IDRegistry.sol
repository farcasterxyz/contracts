 * @notice IDRegistry enables any ETH address to claim a unique Farcaster ID (fid). An address
 *         can only custody one fid at a time and may transfer it to another address. The Registry
 *         starts in a trusted mode where only a trusted caller can register an fid and can move
 *         to an untrusted mode where any address can register an fid. The Registry implements
 *         a recovery system which allows the custody address to nominate a recovery address that
 *         can transfer the fid to a new address after a delay.
