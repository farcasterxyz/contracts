 *
 * @notice NameRegistry lets any ETH address claim a Farcaster Name (fname). A name is a rentable
 *         ERC-721 that can be registered for one year by paying a fee. On expiry, the owner has
 *         30 days to renew the name by paying a fee, or it is placed in a dutch autction.
 *
 *         The NameRegistry starts in the seedable state where only a trusted caller can register
 *         fnames and can be moved to an open state where any address can register an fname. The
 *         Registry implements a recovery system which lets the address nominate a recovery address
 *         that can transfer the fname to a new address after a delay.
